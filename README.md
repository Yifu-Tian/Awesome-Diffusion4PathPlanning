## 0. Introduction
Path Planning is a widely discussed topics in various domains such as robotics, autonomous driving and navigation systems. Classic methods including search-based, sampling-based and optimization-based methods are typically limited by increasing planning time as the complexity of the environment increases. 

Diffusion models, originally developed for generative tasks like image synthesis, have shown promising results applying to path planning. The diffusion models initially add noise to data in multiple steps, progressively corrupting the input until it becomes pure noise. During the reverse process, the model learns to gradually denoise the corrupted data to recover the original structure. This mechanism, known as the denoising process, allows diffusion models to generate high-quality outputs from noisy inputs. In the context of path planning, this process can be adapted to generate optimal or feasible paths, especially in environments with uncertain or dynamic obstacles and some other nonlinear constraints.
